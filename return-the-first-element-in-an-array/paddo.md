```js
function getFirstValue(arr) {
  return arr.shift();
}
```

## Strategy

The goal of the getFirstValue function is to retrieve the first element of an
array and return it. Paddo chose the strategy to use shift method to access the
first value in the array. This is how he determine which value to return.

## Implementation

Paddo use the shift() method on the array. This method removes the first element
from the array and returns it. The function returns the value obtained from the
shift() operation, which is the first element of the original array.
